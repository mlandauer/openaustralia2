      Opening up the procedures of Parliament
    %p
      So far we've shown you what they say (speeches) not what they do (procedures). Believe it or not proceedings of Parliament take place within a highly structured system. The speeches don't always give the full picture of what's going on. So, to help provide some more context, we've now added "procedural text".
    %p
      Procedural text is a standardised description of what's going on. Examples include: someone putting forward a motion, reading a bill, a debate ending, or someone leaving the chamber.
    %p
      We hadn't included it in the past because we simply hadn't supported the translation of the information from the official source.
    %p
      Also, we have a further incentive. It's also preparation for some very exciting new developments which we hope to announce soon!
